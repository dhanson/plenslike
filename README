PLENSLIKE
=========

This is a library which contains code and data files associated with the Planck lensing likelihood. 

Multiple likelihoods are available, based on different data cuts and band combinations. The likelihood data files are human readable, and located in the plenslike/data directory. 

Each likelihood file describes a choice of bins (l_{min}^{i}, l_{max}^{i}), the weight function for accumulating signal into the bins (C_l^{pp, fid.} V_l^{-1}), measured amplitudes for each bin, and an associated covariance matrix.

The likelihood for a potential power spectrum C_l^{pp} is calculated as

lnL[C_l^{pp}] = -1/2 \sum_{ij} ( D^{i}[C_l^{pp}] - D^{i}[\hat{C}_l^{pp}] ) \sigma^{-1}_{ij} \sum_{ij} ( D^{j}[C_l^{pp}] - D^{j}[\hat{C}_l^{pp}] )

where D^{i}[C_l] is a binning function given by

D^{i}[C_l] = (\sum_{l_{min}^{i}}^{l_{max}^{i}} C_l C_l^{pp, fid} V_l^{-1}) / (\sum_{l_{min}^{i}}^{l_{max}^{i}} (C_l^{pp, fid})^2 V_l^{-1})

D^{i}[\hat{C}_l^{pp}] are the measured bin values.

The bin covariance \sigma_{ij} is determined from simulations based on a fiducial bestfit cosmology C_l^{TT, fid} and beam transfer functions. It includes the uncertainty due to CMB+EFG+Noise power, and the point source shot-noise correction. Cosmological and beam uncertainties may be accounted for (if desired) in a sampling approach by renormalizing the estimates. Given an underlying theoretical lensing power spectrum C_l^{pp, th} and revised estimates of C_l^{TT} and beam transfer function, this is accomplished by renormalizing the theoretical power spectrum to account for the difference between the fiducial normalization and that expected given the revised cosmology/beam description. Code to apply this renormalization when calculating the likelihood is provided.

There are multiple formats for the likelihood files, depending on how many effective beams and effective filter functions are needed to describe the lensing measurement:

* "mono"
      This format describes to a likelihood based on lens reconstruction from a single map with a single effective beam. The likelihood file contains the associated filter function F_l and beam B_l^{fid}.
